# My Drama Mate

I developed this project as part of my final year work, and it was a truly enjoyable experience. Not only did I get to apply my skills, but I also created a tool that I will personally use to discover my next drama recommendations. It eliminates the hassle of endlessly scrolling through options, helping me quickly find what to watch next. This project has made my viewing experience more efficient and personalized, and I hope it will benefit other drama enthusiasts as well.

I am using content-based filtering to give recommendations based on the attributes of the dramas, such as genre, cast, and rating. By analyzing the similarities between these attributes, the system suggests relevant dramas tailored to the user's preferences.

# Limitation 

- The data currently does not refresh automatically, meaning that the recommendations are based on static data at the time of scraping.
- The drama titles in the recommender system are displayed as plain text and are not hyperlinked to their respective drama pages. *I'm trying to find if there a workaround on this with Streamlit*.
